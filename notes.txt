The app needs to, at the bare minimum:
    [DONE] Find/Declare a/several root music dir(s)
    []     Scan for known music formats in said root folders (although this could also just be generic/not care about files specifically being "music")
    []     Populate a local database with the paths to said files
    []     Create "playlist" tables of selected songs in said database
    []     Create folders with the names of said playlists in the music root
    []     Soft/hard-link (or whatever OS equivalent for non-linux) each file into the respective folders
